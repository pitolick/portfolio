##  Onesie Pro ##

Onesie Pro is the premium version of our free landing page theme Onesie. It offers the same pleasing landing page aesthetic but we've expanded its functionality to include blog posts, pages, portoflio entries and e-commerce integration through our Sell Media plugin. It is an out-of-the-box solution for everyone who craves a pleasantly simple portfolio that doesn't distract and is easy to manage.

Onesie Pro also applies the simplicity of Onesie's design to its content management, streamlining the process to a few clicks rather than swimming in code. We've added drag and drop functionality to help you easily customize the order of your content at the touch of your mouse.

### What Is Included ###

1. Custom Background image support.
2. Robust theme options page for adding content to the landing page.
3. Add infinite Portfolio entries on the theme options page.
4. All sections are optional (portfolio, about, contact). This means you could just use it to show the site title, description and call to action button.

### Installation ###

1. Download the zip file from your [members dashboard](https://graphpaperpress.com/dashboard/). This will always be the most current version of the theme.
2. Log in to your WordPress dashboard. This can be found at yourdomain.com/wp-admin
3. Go to Appearance &gt; Themes and click on the *Install Themes* tab
4. Click on the *Upload* link
5. Upload the zip file that you downloaded from your members dashboard and click *Install Now*
6. Click *Activate* to use the theme you just installed.

### Integration with Sell Media plugin ###

Onesie Pro will work without the Sell Media plugin active, but, to take advantage of many of the features you see on the theme demo site, you must activate and configure the Sell Media plugin.

1. Download and install Sell Media, Sell Media Advanced Search (included in the purchase of this them).
2. Configure the Sell Media plugin settings at Sell Media > Settings.
3. Configure the new Sell Media widgets at Appearance > Widgets.
4. Configure the required Sell Media page templates (see Page Templates section below)
5. Configure your menus at Appearance > Menus (see Menus section below)

### Organizing your Homepage ###

To setup the theme like the demo go to Appearance > Theme Options and click on the Homepage tab. Here you will be able to select pages to display in your About, Blog and Contact sections. The Portfolio and Sell Media sections appear after enabling them here as well. Onesie Pro should display content in the front page after you've populated your Portfolio, Sell Media section and the pages you've selected.

You are also able to organize the sections you can display in the front page of Onesie Pro through drag and drop. You may choose to not show any of the sections by not specifying pages to display in unwanted sections.

You may display your About, Blog and Contact pages by creating different pages and assigning them to their respective sections in this menu.

### Page Templates ###

This theme provides eight page templates: Default, Blog (grid), Blog (list), Collections, Dashboard, Lightbox, Portfolio and Sell Media Items.

1. The Default page template is the standard page layout, and will display the Sidebar if you have it activated in your widgets area.
2. The Blog page templates will display all of your blog posts on this page. You can determine how many posts will appear on each page before the 'Older Entries' link in Settings > Reading, by setting a value for 'Blog Pages Display at Most'. Their appearance is determined by your choice of grid or list style display.
3. The Portfolio page template displays the featured images for all of your Portfolio entries on your page. You can choose the layout for how the featured images appear on this page in your Theme Options.
4. The Collections page template will display all your Sell Media Collections.
5. Sell Media Items page template will display your Sell Media Items.
6. Dashboard page template will display Sell Media user dashboard.

### Setting up the Lightbox ###

Setting up the Lightbox is a two step process:

1. Create a new Page called "Lighbox" and add this shortcode to the page: [sell_media_lightbox]
2. Add the new Lightbox page to the Menu and give it this CSS class: lightbox-menu

### Widgets ###

If you've enabled Sell Media on Onesie Pro, you'll be able to use Widgets to offer more detail about your photography in individual photo pages. There are two widget sections in these page: on the sidebar and below the image. You may use any widgets in these sections but we recommend using Sell Media Similar Items, Sell Media Recent Items, Sell Media Exif and Sell Media Social Share, to encourage users to visit more of your photography and share with their friends.

### Embed Multimedia into Posts or Pages ###

For externally hosted videos (for example a YouTube or Vimeo video), you can directly paste the link of your video page into the content editor. You do not have to paste the embed code. WordPress will automatically embed the video from the link.

You can easily embed videos from a Video hosting service such as Vimeo or YouTube into your posts or pages.

To add a video:

1. From your WordPress dashboard, add a new post or page (or edit an existing post or page).
2. Paste in your videoâ€™s URL, for example https://vimeo.com/31985752.
3. Publish or Update your post or page.

*Please note: If your video is not appearing correctly, remove the â€˜sâ€™ from the URL, so https becomes http.*

### Theme Options ###

Visit the Appearance -> Theme Options page. Fill in the General and Portfolio tabs. The Color tab is completely optional.

### Social Media Icons ###

You can add social media icons to your Bottom menu.

In your Menus panel on your dashboard, click on the arrow for each menu item to open the details box. You should see an option for *CSS Classes*. If you do not see this option, click the *Screen Options* link at the top of the page and make sure *CSS Classes* is checked in the menu that opens up.

To specify which icon will display, enter the corresponding class name in the CSS Classes box. Please note that these class names are case sensitive. The corresponding class names are: twitter, facebook, feed, vimeo, google-plus, pinterest, github, youtube, linkedin, wordpress.
